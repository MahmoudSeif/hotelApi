# hotelApi
I used Repo Structure to do this task. i did the filteration and sort functions.
All you need is to clone the project then use php artisan command to run it then follow the api route.
First API is post type and here is the body parameters:
-name
-city
-price_from
-price_to
-date_from
-date_no
Second API is get type and here is the parameter used: type
# You need to update composer because I used GuzzleHttp package.
